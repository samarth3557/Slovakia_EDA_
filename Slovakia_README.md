# Slovakia_COVID_19
  The ultimate goal of this project is to analyse and predict the number of new cases for the country Slovakia for upcoming days, which is planning timeline for reopening/lockdown. The number of COVID-19 cases in Slovakia is increasing at a rapid pace. The  Authorities are having a hard time to create a pattern, analyze and forecast the spread of COVID-19 in Slovakia. 
           
  To meet the goal of our project. We will run EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) and build our predictive model using SIR.The main purpose of Exploratory Data Analysis is to help look at the data before making any assumption, The Covid-19 pandemic is the most crucial health disaster that has surrounded the world for the past year. The following data helps us to understand the consequences of the COVID‚Äê19 outbreak.
          
   We'll try to start building our model using the data of Slovakia. The choice of this country is that as compared to the country was thoughtful and considerable, the Slovakia shows the good result in mastering the spread of the disease  COVID-19. And also this choice was considered based on the run EDA which uses data viisualization to draw the meaningful patterns and insights.
